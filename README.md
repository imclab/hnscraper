HN Scrapper cron to scrap Hacker News frontpage data. This cron is used in [http://hnbests.com](http://hnbests.com). HN bests is a personal project of mine to learn MongoDB, Node.js, express.js and backbone.js. You can find the [statistics panel](https://github.com/sasanrose/hnpanel) repository here at github. I would be grateful if you could tell me about my mistakes in code or add features to the project by contributing to it.
